# MyBB Hook Finder

Locate hooks within MyBB including arguments passed to the hook and the file/line the hook is called in/on.

## Running this script

This script should be placed in the root of a MyBB install and ran as any other ruby script should be ran. The output is stored in HTML format in output.html. If you're on windows, your browser should open the new file as soon as it's finished being written. I have not tested this on any other platform though.
